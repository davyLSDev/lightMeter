# lightMeter
This light meter is envisioned for being used with a 4x5 camera.

## About
The intial code commit was based on prior art in *solar_lcdMeter* sketch found in my [arduino-testing](https://github.com/davyLSDev/arduino-testing) repo.

## Hardware required
* Arduino Uno (if not this exact model, you might need to adapt this software a bit)
* a solar panel (you might need to tweak the calculations for the meters)
* a potentiometer
* a couple of pushbutton switches
* an Nokia 5110 lcd panel
